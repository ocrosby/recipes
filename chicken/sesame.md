Cornstarch and/or Arrowroot Powder: These are essential for thickening the sauce and creating a glossy, appealing finish.
Soy Sauce (Light and Dark): Soy sauce provides the umami and savory depth, while dark soy sauce adds a rich color.
Rice Vinegar or White Vinegar: Vinegar adds a bright, tangy counterpoint to the sweetness.
Sugar: The sweetness is crucial, balancing the savory elements and making the dish more appealing.
Toasted Sesame Seeds: These are sprinkled on top to add a nutty aroma and flavor.
Sesame Oil: While not always a primary ingredient, sesame oil can be added at the end for a distinct aroma and flavor.
Ginger and Garlic: These are often used to add depth to the sauce.
