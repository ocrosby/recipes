ðŸ¥— Gladnessâ€™s Visual-Based Chicken Salad

A flexible, flavorful chicken salad recipe made without measuring cups â€” just taste, texture, and good vibes.

Ingredients (use your eyes and tastebuds!)
	â€¢	2 cans shredded chicken (drained)
	â€¢	Seedless grapes (halved) â€” add until balanced with the chicken
	â€¢	Celery (chopped) â€” enough to give it a nice crunch
	â€¢	Walnuts or almonds (chopped) â€” for extra texture and depth
	â€¢	Mayonnaise â€” just enough to coat everything nicely
	â€¢	Garlic powder â€” to taste
	â€¢	Salt & black pepper â€” to taste

Instructions
	1.	In a large mixing bowl, add the shredded chicken.
	2.	Add grapes, celery, and nuts until it looks right â€” evenly distributed, balanced.
	3.	Sprinkle in garlic powder, salt, and pepper â€” start light, mix, taste, and adjust.
	4.	Add mayonnaise gradually while mixing until the salad reaches your preferred creaminess.
	5.	Chill if you have time, or serve immediately if youâ€™re hungry.

Serving Suggestions
	â€¢	On croissants for a fancy twist
	â€¢	In lettuce wraps for something lighter
	â€¢	With crackers for snacking
	â€¢	Or just eat it with a spoon â€” we wonâ€™t judge
