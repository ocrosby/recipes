## Cooking Tips

- The roux is the foundation of gumbo - take your time with this step
- Rendering the sausage first adds depth of flavor to the roux
- Baking the chicken keeps it moist and the drippings add richness
- If the roux burns, discard it and start over
- Gumbo tastes even better the next day after flavors have melded
- Can be frozen for up to 3 months
