# Smoked Duck

- Rosemary
- Thyme
- Garlic
- Parsley
- Salt
- Pepper
- Paprika
- White Onion

Make sure the skin of the duck is completely dry before you start. This will help the skin crisp up nicely.

Cook until the duck reaches an internal temperature of 170Â°F. This will ensure the duck is cooked through and safe to eat.
