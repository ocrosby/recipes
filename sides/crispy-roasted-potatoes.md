# Crispy Roasted Potatoes

Golden brown, deeply seasoned, and crisp on the outside while fluffy on the inside. These potatoes are designed to stand up to rich mains and soak up pan sauces without going soggy.

## Ingredients

* 1½–2 lb potatoes (Yukon gold preferred; red potatoes also work)
* 2–3 tbsp olive oil
* 1½ tsp kosher salt (plus more to finish)
* ½ tsp freshly cracked black pepper
* Optional seasoning (choose 1–2):

  * ½ tsp garlic powder
  * ½ tsp smoked paprika
  * 1 tsp fresh rosemary or thyme, finely chopped

## How to Chop the Potatoes (This Matters)

1. **Wash and dry** the potatoes thoroughly.
2. If using Yukon golds, peeling is optional. For reds, leave skins on.
3. Cut each potato **lengthwise in half**.
4. Lay the flat side down and cut into **1–1½ inch chunks**.
5. Aim for **uniform size** so everything cooks evenly.

> Too small = dry and hard. Too large = soft centers with weak browning.

## How to Season Properly

1. Place chopped potatoes in a large bowl.
2. Drizzle with olive oil.
3. Sprinkle salt **evenly from high above** (this helps distribution).
4. Add pepper and any optional seasonings.
5. Toss thoroughly with your hands until:

   * All surfaces are lightly glossy
   * Seasoning is evenly coated
   * No dry spots remain

> If the bowl looks dry after tossing, add **another small drizzle of oil**.

## Roasting Instructions

1. Preheat oven to **425°F (220°C)**.
2. Place an empty baking sheet in the oven while it heats (optional but recommended).
3. Carefully remove hot sheet and spread potatoes **cut-side down**.
4. Do not overcrowd — use two sheets if needed.
5. Roast **25–30 minutes** without touching them.
6. Flip potatoes and roast **10–15 minutes more** until deeply golden and crisp.

## Finishing

* Taste and sprinkle with additional salt if needed.
* Optional finishes:

  * Fresh herbs
  * Grated parmesan
  * A light drizzle of garlic oil

---

## Notes

* High heat is essential — lower temperatures will steam the potatoes.
* Preheating the baking sheet dramatically improves browning.
* These reheat well in a hot oven or air fryer.
